			<p>My name is Kelana Latimer.  I am 34 years old and live in Austin Texas.  I have an 11 month old son, a dog named Opal, and a horse named Holly who lives in Ohio with a friend.  I was born in Austin but left when I was only 6 years old and just moved back a year ago.  I haven't had a chance to explore much of the city yet since I was super pregnant when I moved here and now have a baby.  I'm looking forward to getting to know my "hometown".</p>
